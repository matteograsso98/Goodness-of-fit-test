## Goodness-of-fit test 

The chi-squared statistics relies on some assumptions that are often not valid in most cosmological scenarios. 
Therefore, a "goodness-of-fit" test is often needed. The code takes the best fit theory vector and create mocks sampling from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. 
Then, the chi-squared and the p-value of the resulting distribution are calculated.
